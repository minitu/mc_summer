* 3 technologies
- InfiniBand, Ethernet RoCE, Ethernet iWARP
- Share a common user API, but different physical and link layers

* RDMA Characteristics
- Provides a messaging service which applications can use to directly access the virtual memory on remote computers (Channel based I/O)
- Low latency through stack bypass and copy avoidance
- Channel based I/O : OS establishes a channel and then allows applications to directly exchange messages without further OS intervention
- Multicast also supported

- The memory semantic is somewhat different; in this case the receiving side
application registers a buffer in its virtual memory space. It passes control of
that buffer to the sending side which then uses RDMA READ or RDMA WRITE
operations to either read or write the data in that buffer.
- The software transport interface also defines all the methods and mechanisms that
an application needs to take full advantage of the RDMA message transport
service.
